Strike through completed todos and place them below e.g. <del>done</del>

# Todos

* Read the terrain.cfg for mapping of terrain
* Read all other configs for other mappings (units, etc...)
* Find the difference between [replay] and [replay_start]
* Parse the replay steps to entities and queue them
* Generate Undo-Steps to make it possible to step back
* Create a Step-Button to make it possible for the user to see step by step.
* Create a "bigger" Step-Button to make it possible for the user to see the whole round of the user
* Create a "round" Step-Button to make it possible for the user to see the whole round of all users
* Create a play-Button to run the replay
* Create a speed-slider (I haven't considered how I will implement the speed. I think client-side)


# Completed
